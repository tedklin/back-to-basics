# Algorithm exercises

The Algorithm Design Manual (Skiena) has a lot of exercises, but without solutions. There is a wiki but the solutions don't seem to be heavily audited. I know writing thorough test cases myself is good practice for real-world scenarios, but they would likely take nontrivial time to create for each exercise, and there's no guarantee of correctness.

There is also a mountain of over 1000 assorted problems on Leetcode, complete with test cases and community auditing. Although I don't doubt that trying all the different kinds of exercises would no doubt help my algorithmic thinking in the long run, I want to balance my time now with developing other skills / creating applicable projects.

Taking all of that into consideration, I plan to:
- implement and play around with a select few fundamental data structures / algorithms from Skiena that I've also seen mentioned time and time again elsewhere in the real world.
- commit to something like one Leetcode problem every other day (for the rest of my life bet), focusing on categories that seem most applicable / foundational.
