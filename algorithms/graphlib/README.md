# graphlib

This is my attempt at implementing a graph library completely from scratch,
based on concepts in Skiena but using different underlying data structures from STL.

My primary goal is to be as intuitive as possible, at the potential
expense of space overhead.

The project setup for this library was created based on [my CMake template](https://github.com/tedklin/cmake_sandbox).
