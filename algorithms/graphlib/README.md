# graphlib

This is my attempt at implementing a graph library completely from scratch,
based on concepts in Skiena but using different underlying data structures from STL.

The primary goal is to be as intuitive as possible, at the potential
expense of space overhead.

This is not meant to be a fully fledged standalone project, but rather a sandbox for me to solidify my understanding of graph theory (and C++). As such, rigorous testing / continuous integration is absent. Regardless, I still tried to maintain correctness, include thorough documentation, and adhere to standard C++ best practices.
