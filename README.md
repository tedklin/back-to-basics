# Back to basics

This is an informal compilation of notes and exercises for fundamental topics and skills I'm self-studying / reviewing, divided into subjects and subdivided into sources.

## Primary study material

- Algorithms
    - Skiena - The Algorithm Design Manual, 2nd Ed.
- C++
    - Lippman, Lajoie, Moo - C++ Primer, 5th Ed.
- ROS
    - ETH Zurich - Programming for Robotics, ROS (online course)


## Disclaimers

### "Write that down, write that down!"

There are several places in my notes where I directly copy and paste important content from my primary study material (I pinky promise this is not because I'm lazy or have plagiaristic tendencies). Proper wording is often important, and I want to minimize information getting lost in translation. 

That being said, there is a chance that things do end up getting lost in translation through improper paraphrasing, omission, etc. I defer to the primary material or reputable sources like official documentation for any points of confusion.

External sources are also sprinkled throughout my notes. They are credited / linked to for their information; otherwise, the information comes from the author(s) of the primary material I'm using for each topic.

***I take no credit or responsibility whatsoever for any information (or missing holes in information) that appears in this repo.***

### "The risk I took was calculated, but man, am I bad at math"

I always attempt exercises myself first, but I also always look for better solutions than what I came up with originally (because there are almost always better solutions). If I find better-performing or more elegant solutions in places other than my own noggin, I embed the appropriate credits in the exercise; otherwise, the work in the exercises is my own. 

***There is no guarantee that anything in this repo is optimal or even correct.*** but I try :)
