# Back to basics

This is an informal compilation of notes and exercises for fundamental skills I'm self-studying, divided into subjects and subdivided into sources.

### "Write that down, write that down!"

There are numerous places in my notes where I just copy and paste content because the authors' wording was already clear / proper wording is important. External sources are credited / linked to for their information; otherwise, the information comes from the author(s) of the primary material I'm studying. I take no credit whatsoever for any information that appears in this repo.

### "The risk I took was calculated, but man, am I bad at math"

I attempt all of the exercises myself first, but afterwards, I almost always look for better solutions than what I came up with originally. Solution credits are embedded in the exercises themselves; otherwise, the work is my own. There is no guarantee that everything is correct.
