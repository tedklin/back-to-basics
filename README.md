# Back to basics

This repository is an informal collection of my self-study/review efforts for fundamental topics and languages. It includes a scattered array of notes and exercises from various books / resources. It also contains mini-projects, which are nontrivial pieces of code, but not large or novel enough to be standalone projects.

## Primary study material

- Algorithms
    - *Skiena - The Algorithm Design Manual, 2nd Ed.*
    - *Sedgewick, Wayne - Algorithms, 4th Ed.*
- C++
    - *Lippman, Lajoie, Moo - C++ Primer, 5th Ed.*
- Python
    - *Sweigart - Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*
- C
    - [Nick Parlante's notes and exercises](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/)
