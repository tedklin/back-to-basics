# Back to basics

This is an informal compilation of notes, exercises, and mini-projects for fundamental topics and skills I'm self-studying / reviewing.

## Primary study material

- Algorithms
    - *Skiena - The Algorithm Design Manual, 2nd Ed.*
- C++
    - *Lippman, Lajoie, Moo - C++ Primer, 5th Ed.*
- ROS (Robot Operating System)
    - ETH Zurich - Programming for Robotics, ROS


## Disclaimers

**1. I take no credit nor responsibility whatsoever for any information that appears in my notes.**

There are several places in my notes where I directly copy and paste important content from my primary study material (I promise this is not because I'm lazy or have plagiaristic tendencies). Proper wording is often important, and I want to minimize information getting lost in translation. 

That being said, there is a chance that things do end up getting lost in translation through improper paraphrasing, omission, etc. I defer to the primary material or reputable sources like official documentation for any points of confusion.

External sources are also sprinkled throughout my notes. They are credited / linked to for their information; otherwise, the information comes from the author(s) of the primary material I'm using for each topic.

**2. There is no guarantee that any code in this repo is optimal or even correct.**

Any code is my own work (with reference to my primary study material) unless otherwise specified.

The various mini-projects in this repo (such as [*graphlib*](https://github.com/tedklin/back-to-basics/tree/master/algorithms/graphlib)) are mostly intended to be playgrounds for me to solidify the various concepts I'm learning. As such, rigorous testing and continuous integration are absent. Regardless, I still tried to maintain correctness, include thorough documentation, and adhere to standard best practices.
