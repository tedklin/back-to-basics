# Back to basics

This is an informal compilation of notes and exercises for fundamental skills I'm self-studying, divided into subjects and subdivided into sources.

### "Write that down, write that down!"

There are several places in my notes where I directly copy and paste content (I pinky promise this is not because I'm lazy or have plagiaristic tendencies). Proper wording is often important, and I don't want anything lost in translation. External sources are also sprinkled throughout my notes. They are credited / linked to for their information; otherwise, the information comes from the author(s) of the primary material I'm studying. 

**I take no credit whatsoever for any information that appears in this repo.**

### "The risk I took was calculated, but man, am I bad at math"

I always attempt exercises myself first, but I also always look for better solutions than what I came up with originally (because there are almost always better solutions). Exercise solution credits are embedded in the exercises themselves; otherwise, the work is my own. 

**There is no guarantee that anything in this repo is optimal or even correct.** but I try :)
