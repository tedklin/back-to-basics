# Back to basics

This repository is an informal collection of my self-study/review efforts for fundamental topics and languages. It includes a scattered array of notes and exercises from various books / resources. It also contains mini-projects, which are nontrivial pieces of code, but not large or novel enough to be standalone projects.

## Primary study material

- Algorithms
    - *Skiena - The Algorithm Design Manual, 2nd Ed.*
    - *Sedgewick, Wayne - Algorithms, 4th Ed.*
- C++
    - *Lippman, Lajoie, Moo - C++ Primer, 5th Ed.*
- Python
    - *Sweigart - Automate the Boring Stuff with Python*

## Disclaimers

**1. I take no credit nor responsibility whatsoever for any information that appears in my notes.**

There are several places in my notes where I directly copy and paste important information from my primary study material (I promise this is not because I'm lazy or have plagiaristic tendencies). Proper wording is often important, and I want to minimize information getting lost in translation. 

That being said, there is a chance that things do end up getting lost in translation through improper paraphrasing, omission, etc. I defer to the primary material or reputable sources like official documentation for any points of confusion.

External sources are also sprinkled throughout my notes. They are credited / linked to for their information; otherwise, the information comes from the author(s) of the primary material I'm using for each topic.

**2. There is no guarantee that any code in this repo is optimal or even correct.**

Any code is my own work (with sole reference to my primary study material) unless otherwise specified.

The exercises and mini-projects in this repo are mostly intended to be playgrounds for me to solidify the various concepts I'm learning / refreshing. As such, I forgoed some standard practices for healthy software, such as unit testing (I just wrote quick ad-hoc tests) and continuous integration. Regardless, I still strived to maintain correctness, modularity, and transparency in my code.
