# Back to basics

This is an informal compilation of notes and exercises for fundamental topics and skills I'm self-studying / reviewing, divided into subjects and subdivided into sources.

## Primary study material

- Algorithms
    - *Skiena - The Algorithm Design Manual, 2nd Ed.*
    - Selected Leetcode exercises
- C++
    - *Lippman, Lajoie, Moo - C++ Primer, 5th Ed.*
- ROS
    - ETH Zurich - Programming for Robotics, ROS (online course)


## Disclaimers

***1. I take no credit nor responsibility whatsoever for any information (or missing information) that appears in this repo.***

There are several places in my notes where I directly copy and paste important content from my primary study material (I promise this is not because I'm lazy or have plagiaristic tendencies). Proper wording is often important, and I want to minimize information getting lost in translation. 

That being said, there is a chance that things do end up getting lost in translation through improper paraphrasing, omission, etc. I defer to the primary material or reputable sources like official documentation for any points of confusion.

External sources are also sprinkled throughout my notes. They are credited / linked to for their information; otherwise, the information comes from the author(s) of the primary material I'm using for each topic.

***2. There is no guarantee that anything in this repo is optimal or even correct.*** but I try :)

I always attempt things myself first. If I find better-performing or more elegant solutions from someone/somewhere else, I embed the appropriate credits in the exercise; otherwise, the work in the exercises is my own (with reference to my primary study material).
