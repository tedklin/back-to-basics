## Binary Tree Preorder Traversal (Q144)

### Clarifying questions to ask

| Question | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Can the input root be null? If so, do we handle that case by returning null or returning an empty List? | Correctness. |

### Recursive solution

See code.

### Followup: iteration instead of recursion

See code.

### Takeaways

- Obvious but important reminders:
  - **Check for nulls!!**
    - In recursive base cases.
    - On **every** insertion (`add`/`push`/`insert`) of an object (reference) into a data structure.
  - Pay attention to what you pass into / return from each function.
  - Pay attention to the type arguments you pass into generic declarations.
