# Question Name (Q001)

Problem statement: https://leetcode.com/problems/


## 1. Fully understand the problem statement, including asking clarifying questions and listing out possible inputs / expected outputs (basic functionality and a couple edge cases).

**Metanotes:**
- **During this step, avoid thinking about possible solutions already.**
- **For the sake of time, don't actually code up the tests unless explicitly asked to.**
- Delete the example rows below to avoid getting confused.

| Clarifying question | Answer | Reason for asking |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ... | ... | ... |
| ... | ... | ... |
| *e.g. Does "subsequence" mean that the elements must be adjacent, or can there be gaps?* |  ... | *Problem semantics.* |
| *e.g. Given a collection, what is the range of possible lengths? Can we assume even/power-of-2 to simplify edge case handling? Can the length be 0?* |  ... | *Input structure / implementation details.* |
| *e.g. Given a collection, what is the range of possible element values?* |  ... | *Input structure: Might open possibilities of algorithms on finite alphabets, e.g. tries, radix sorts.* |
| *e.g. Given a graph, what is the range of possible edge weight values?* |  ... | *Input structure: Might open / close opportunities to use certain algorithms, e.g. Dijkstra's.* |
| *e.g. Are elements in the input collection unique or can they be repeated?* |  ... | *Input structure: Might open / close opportunities to use hashsets/maps or actively prune search space.* |
| *e.g. Given multiple collections, can we assume they are of same length?* |  ... | *Input structure: Affects efficiency analysis and possible solutions / implementation details.* |
| *e.g. Is in-place modification of the input allowed?* | ... | *Problem semantics: Affects additional-memory analysis and possible solutions / implementation details.* |
| *e.g. If there are multiple equally-optimal outputs, what should be returned?* |  ... | *Implementation details.* |
| *e.g. What should I do/return if the input is invalid / does not match the constraints?* |  ... | *Implementation details.* |

| Input | Expected output | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ... | ... | ... |
| ... | ... | ... |
| *e.g.* `[1]` |  `1` |  *Base case.* |
| *e.g.* `[1, 2, 3]` |  `3` |  *Basic functionality.* |
| *e.g.* `[3, 2, 1]` |  `1` |  *Basic functionality.* |
| *e.g.* `[1, 3, 2, 3]` |  `2` |  *Basic functionality.* |
| *e.g.* `[1, 2, 3, 1, 2]` |  `3` |  *Basic functionality.* |
| *e.g.* `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3]` |  `3` |  *Basic functionality.* |
| *e.g.* `[]` |  `0` |  *Edge case.* |
| *e.g.* `None` |  `0` |  *Edge case.* |


## 2. Brainstorm - quick name-listing of ANY possibly relevant solution directions (techniques, data structures, simplifying-transformations of input like sorting/mapping, etc.).

**Metanotes:**
- **Don't spend too much time on the first-pass brainstorm - this list is meant to be revisited and heavily pruned / added to throughout the process.**
    - **Don't worry about correctness / fully fleshing out the solution directions that come to mind - just list them out first.**
