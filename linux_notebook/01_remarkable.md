# entry 01
should i stop doing the entry thing? it feels so artificial, but i don't know what else to title this hodgepodge of stuff...

## workflow

i'm getting to the point where i can work on ubuntu just as efficiently as i could on my mac, but there are still a few things i want to figure out:

1. window manager!
	- the default gnome desktop comes with an acceptable split screen (1+1) function, but i often like a 1+2 or 1+3 split where i have my text editor on one side and simulation+shell+file manager on the other.
	
		> yes i agree workspaces are amazing but sometimes i wanna visualize a lot of things at once yknow
		
	- found really cool tile managers like [i3](https://i3wm.org/) and [awesomewm](https://awesomewm.org/), but not really sure how much of a hassle those are to set up or how much trouble that might cost me in the future.
	- from my naive review of other people's workflows, things like tmux are less intrusive on my system (and come with a lot of other functionality that carries across machines).
	- i think for now im ok with just the 1+1 split that comes with gnome (that might also force me to get more comfortable with bash) and manually organizing windows for when i want multiple shells / simulations / other programs running on the same workspace.

2. external monitors
	- kind of in line with window management, sometimes i like to visualize a lot of things at once and a nice monitor would help me do that.
	- ive seen workstations with combinations of horizontal and *vertical* monitors, and those look absolutely ***gorgeous*** and extremely effective for editing code and running visual sims, but i'm on a college student budget *yeet*.
	- my only option right now is to take an old hand-me-down monitor from my dad (i used it for some raspberry pi computer vision work in the past, and i definitely won't complain about the extra real estate it gives me if it works, but it's no bezel-free vertical beast of a screen).
	
		> beggars unfortunately cannot be choosers :(

3. mouse
	- the laptop im working on right now (dell xps 13 9300 flex) has been pretty much perfect for me so far. the optimized form factor is both portable and aesthetically pleasing af.
	- only thing is the **trackpad** is soooooo **tiny** (it's as big as it could be and horizontally it's more than enough. but vertically? nah fam i'm avoiding that pitfall) and my **hands** are **big**
	- luckily i got a decent cheap wireless mouse that's working well, but i miss all of the shortcuts i could do with my mac's trackpad.
	- the mouse has a solid 8 buttons (i never even imagined a scrollwheel could pack in 4 on its own)
	- so another thing on my TODO is figuring out custom mouse bindings (and how much i want to rely on those for my workflow)
	
a big thing i'm keeping at the forefront of my mind with all this shortcut stuff is how much customization i'm making. 
	
- do i really need a bunch of bash aliases or will that make me unable to do simple stuff on a system that doesn't have my dotfiles? i know dotfiles are ultra portable but i feel like i need to have a solid grounding in low-level stuff before i go ham with customization. 
- also a driving force behind why i want to get good at vim eventually: so i can work on pretty much any machine that i encounter (yay for headless machines).

## markdown

- i downloaded a really cool sublime package for markdown! then i realized that i'm not comfortable enough with markdown to edit it without a live preview.

- enter [Remarkable](http://remarkableapp.github.io)! 

- i didn't even know i can *do this*:

$$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$$

> *mathjax* / *latex* / general formatting and editing stuff is also on my long list of things to learn. i think i'll get to practice these in upper div ee courses.

- i also didn't know you could specify language for blocks of code (oops):

~~~java
public static void main (String[] args) {
	System.out.println("follow me on spotify!");
}
~~~

##### *anyways* 

i'll be playing around with markdown a lot more in my coming notebooks. i'll be moving away from linux-specific stuff for a while and focusing on learning c++.
