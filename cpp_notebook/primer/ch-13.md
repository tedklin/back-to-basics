# chapter 13: copy control

## copy, assign, destroy (13.1)

### main core ideas
- a constructor is the ***copy constructor*** if its first parameter is a **reference to its class-type** and any additional parameters have default values.
	- usually the parameter is reference to const.
	- usually not *explicit* (copy constructor is often used implicitly).
	- if not manually defined, the copy constructor is **always** synthesized! (as opposed to [synthesized default constructors](https://github.com/tedklin/pseudoblog/blob/master/cpp_notebook/primer/ch-07.md#constructors))
		- the synthesized copy constructor performs (nonstatic) memberwise copying (using each member's respective copy constructor).
	- copy constructors are also used in [copy initialization](https://github.com/tedklin/pseudoblog/blob/master/cpp_notebook/primer/ch-02.md#variables-22).
~~~
// example copy constructor declaration
class Foo {
	Foo(const Foo& foo);
};
~~~

- the ***copy-assignment operator*** is a function overload of the = operator.
	- for consistency purposes, assignment operators ordinarily should return a reference to their left-hand operand (which can be accessed through the implicit *this* pointer).
	- if not manually defined, the copy-assignment operator is **always** synthesized.
		- the synthesized version performs (nonstatic) memberwise assignment (using each member's respective copy-assignment operator).
		- also returns a reference to its left-hand operand.
~~~
// example copy-assignment operator overload declaration
class Foo {
public:
	Foo& operator=(const Foo&);
};
~~~

- the ***destructor*** frees the resources used by an object and destroys the nonstatic data members of the object.
	- **the destructor runs its function body, then implicitly performs memberwise destruction** (calls destructors for class-type members, does nothing for built-in type members).
		- note that the implicit destruction of a raw pointer does not *delete* the object to which that pointer points.
	- if not manually defined, the destructor is **always** synthesized.
		- the synthesized version is just a destructor with an empty body (memberwise destruction is always implicitly performed).

// example destructor declaration
class Foo {
public:
	~Foo();
};
