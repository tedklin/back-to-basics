# chapter 13: copy control

## copy, assign, destroy (13.1)

### main core ideas
- a constructor is the ***copy constructor*** if its first parameter is a reference to the class-type and any additional parameters have default values.
	- usually the parameter is reference to const.
	- usually not *explicit* (copy constructor is often used implicitly).
	- a copy constructor is **always** synthesized if it's not manually defined (as opposed to [synthesized default constructors](https://github.com/tedklin/pseudoblog/blob/master/cpp_notebook/primer/ch-07.md#constructors)).
		- the synthesized copy constructor performs memberwise copying for each nonstatic member. 
			- members of another class type are copied by the copy constructor for that respective class.
