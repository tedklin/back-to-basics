# chapter 6: functions

## basics (6.1)

### new core ideas
- function call
	- execution of a function begins with the (implicit) definition and initialization of its parameters (listed in the function definition) from arguments the caller passes in.
		- the type of each argument must match the corresponding parameter in the same way that the type of any initializer must match the type of the object it initializes.
			- the type of the arguments we pass in must be convertible (and will be converted) to the type of the parameter, just like in regular initialization.
	- the return type cannot be an array type or a function type, but can be a pointer to an array or function (see below).
- scope and lifetime
	- the ***scope*** of a name is the part of the program's text in which that name is visible.
	- the ***lifetime*** of an object is the time during the program's execution that the object exists.
- local objects
	- are parameters and variables defined inside a function body.
	- ordinary local objects are created when the function's control path passes through the variable definition and destroyed when control passes through the end of the block in which the variable is defined.
		- aka ***automatic objects***
		- default initialized if no initializer (to undefined if built-in type).
		- parameters are also automatic objects.
	- a ***local static object*** (a local variable with keyword *static*) persists until the program terminates.
		- initialized before the first time execution passes through the object's definition.
		- value initialized if no initializer (to zero if built-in type).
		- subsequent calls ignore(?) the initialization statement because the variable already exists (initialization is not assignment!).

size_t count_calls() {
	static size_t ctr = 0;
	return ++ctr;
}

int main() {
	// prints the numbers from 1 through 10 inclusive
	for (size_t i = 0; i != 10; ++i) {
		cout << count_calls() << '\n';
	}
	return 0;
}

- function declarations
	- aka *function prototype*
	- a function may only be defined once but can be declared multiple times (like variables)
	- a function declaration is just like a function definition except the function body is replaced with a semicolon
		- parameter names are not required, but can help users of the function understand what the function does.
	- **functions should be declared in header files and defined in source files.**
		- the source file that defines a function should #include the header that declares the function.
		- these files can be compiled separately and linked.

## argument passing (6.2)

### new core ideas
- **parameter initialization works the same way as variable intialization!**
- **passing arguments by value**
	- when we initialize a *nonreference*-type variable, the value of the initializer is **copied**.
		- changes made to the variable inside the function have no effect on the initializer.
	- pointers are also copied and can be used normally with address-type arguments (but generally use pass by reference instead).
- **passing arguments by reference**
	- reference parameters allow a function to change the value of corresponding arguments.
	- using reference parameters avoids inefficient large copies.
		- some classes cannot be copied at all and require the use of reference parameters.
	- reference pointers can be used to "return" multiple values from a function.
- **const parameters and arguments**
	- refer back to ch2 for general initialization rules!
		- recall [plain reference/pointer type matching rules](https://github.com/tedklin/pseudoblog/blob/master/cpp_notebook/primer/ch-02.md#compound-types-23) and [top-level / low-level const rules](https://github.com/tedklin/pseudoblog/blob/master/cpp_notebook/primer/ch-02.md#const-qualifier-24).
	- **reference parameters that are not changed inside a function should be *references to const*.**
		- using a plain reference type parameter not only misleads the function caller, but also greatly limits the type of arguments that can be passed in! (can't pass const, literal, or any object that requires conversion)
- array parameters
	- recall from ch3 that we cannot "copy" an array, and when we use an array it usually decays into a pointer.
		- [run-down of what actually happens when we pass arrays into functions (array-to-pointer decay), as well as how to pass arrays by reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1461432/what-is-array-to-pointer-decay)
		-  when we aren't sure of size or want size flexibility, we can add an additional parameter representing size.
			- or just get rid of the array parameter and pass in pointers returned by *begin(myArray)* and *end(myArray)* from the *iterator* library header (standard library convention).
			- or use templates (ch16)
- passing arguments to main
	- main can take two optional parameters:
		- *int argc* representing the number of command-line arguments (program arguments + 1)
		- *char &ast;&ast;argv* representing an array of pointers to C-style character strings storing the command-line arguments.
			- the first element (index 0) in *argv* points to the name of the program or the empty string, the rest point to the program CL arguments.
- functions with varying number of parameters, all of the same type
	- we can pass a library template type called ***initializer_list*** defined in the library header of the same name.
		- elements in an initializer_list are always const.
		- copying or assigning initializer_list's to each other results in both the original and the copy sharing the elements.
		- initializer_list has standard member functions size(), begin(), and end().
	- we must use curly braces around the argument sequence of values we pass into an initializer_list parameter.
	- functions with an initializer_list parameter can still have other parameters.
	- we can use a range-for on initializer_list (as with all types that have *begin* and *end* iterators).


### misc conventions and tips
- C programmers might often use pointer parameters to access objects outside a function. C++ programmers generally use reference parameters instead.
- [pass by reference to const vs pass by value](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/270408/is-it-better-in-c-to-pass-by-value-or-pass-by-constant-reference)
- see ch16 for functions with parameters whose type might vary (variadic templates).
