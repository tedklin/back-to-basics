# chapter 9: sequential containers

Primer seems to serve as a good standalone reference for info on sequential containers. This will just be a non-exhaustive collection of serious pitfalls to watch out for and good practices to keep in mind when dealing with sequential containers.

## misc conventions and tips

- library swap is fast! also get into the habit of using the nonmember version of swap because generic programs will likely need it. 
	- *std::swap(c1, c2)* instead of *c1.swap(c2)*
- recall relational operators are dictionary ordered!
- **calling *front()* or *back()* on an *empty* container, like using a subscript that is out of range, is a serious error!**
	- behavior is undefined, so compiler likely won't even tell you something's wrong.
