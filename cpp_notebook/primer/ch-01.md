# chapter 1: getting started

not gonna take traditional notes on the material, just some core ideas that are specific to c++ / that i haven't encountered before in other languages and some additional external links / other things to follow up on.

## new core ideas
- istream, ostream; cin, cout, cerr, clog; <<, >> operators
	- behind the scenes of chaining cout / cin statements
	- using istream state as a condition (see 1.4.3)
- namespaces and the scope :: operator
- classes and the dot . operator.
- "a primary focus of the design of C++ is to make it possible to define class types that behave as naturally as the build-in types"
- file redirection on unix (see 1.5.1)


## misc conventions and tips

- the *-Wall* option for g++ enables all compiler warning messages. this is generally recommended to always be used.
- [std::endl vs "\n" for cout](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/213907/c-stdendl-vs-n)
	- endl is a *manipulator* that flushes stream buffer, might lead to [performance issues](https://chat.stackoverflow.com/transcript/10?m=1878187#1878187) if you use it everytime. **you should default to '\n'.**
	- cout is also flushed when program ends normally or when a subsequent cin is executed.
- [good summary video of cout, cerr, and clog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHGR_kH0PNA)
	- writes to **cerr** are not buffered, so use this for error messages / debugging.
	- writes to **clog** are buffered. used to report info to a log file.
- [#include <> vs include ""](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Include-Syntax.html)
- incrementing with [x++ vs ++x](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1812990/incrementing-in-c-when-to-use-x-or-x)
	- first check logic!
		- no logical difference when increments are isolated statements, but it sometimes matters when they're nested in other expressions.
	- otherwise, prefix is generally more efficient.
- eof is usually control-d on unix systems.


## things to follow up on

- in a program where i return -1 in the main method, gcc compiled it and i ran it without a hitch. iirc in java, returning -1 would cause the system to print something like "System exited with error code -1". should i be seeing something from the compiler?
	- error code -1 turns into 255 when viewing the environment variable *$?*
- how to get multiline comment automation like intellij
