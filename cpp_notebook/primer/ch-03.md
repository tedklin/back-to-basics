# chapter 3: strings, vectors, and arrays

## namespace *using* declarations (3.1)

### new core ideas
- the **scope operator ::** says that the compiler should look in the scope (namespace) of the left-hand operand for the name of the right-hand operatand
- a ***using*** declaration lets us use a name from a namespace without qualifying the name with *(namespace)::* prefix
	- a separate *using* declaration is required for each name

~~~
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using std::cin; using std::cout;
using std::string;
int main() {
	string i;
	cin >> i; // cin is a synonym for std::cin
	cout << i << '\n'; // cout is a synonym for std::cout
	return 0;
}
~~~

### misc conventions and tips
- **code in headers should not use *using* declarations**
	- recall contents of a header are copied into the including programs text. if a header has a *using* declaration, then every program that includes that header gets that same *using* declaration.


## library *string* type (3.2)

### new core ideas
- forms of initialization
	- *default initialize* to empty string (covered before in ch2).
	- *copy initialize* copies the initializer on the right-hand side of an = sign. this can be used with a single initializer.
	- *direct initialize* omits the = sign and can be used with initializers that consist of more than one value.
~~~
// ways to initialize a string
string s1; // default initialization to the empty string
string s2(s1); // s2 is a copy of s1, direct initialized
string s2 = s1; // same as above, copy initialized
string s3("value"); // s3 is a copy of the string literal, direct initialized
string s3 = "value"; // same as above, copy initialized
string s4(n, 'c'); // initialize s4 with n copies of the character 'c', direct initialized
~~~

- **classes can define how objects are created/initialized, operations that are called by name, and what various operator symbols (<<, +, etc.) mean when applied to objects of the class' type.**
~~~
// string operations
// 's' is string, 'os' is output stream, 'is' is input stream
// positions are zero-indexed

os << s // writes s onto os, returns os
is >> s // reads whitespace-separated string from is into s, returns is
getline(is, s) // reads a line of input from is into s (not including the newline), returns is.
s.empty() // returns true if s is empty, otherwise returns false
s.size() // returns the (unsigned size_type) number of characters in s
s[n] // returns a reference to the char at position (unsigned size_type) n in s.
s1 + s2 // returns a string that is the concatenation of s1 and s2
s1 = s2 // replaces characters in s1 with a copy of s2

// the strings s1 and s2 are equal if they contain the same characters.
// equality is case sensitive. 
// comparisons use case-senstive dictionary ordering.
s1 == s2 // !=, <, <=, >, >=
~~~

- concatenation
	- the string library lets us convert both character literals and character string literals to strings (so we can automatically concatenate them).
	- at least one operand to each + operator must be of *string* type.
	- **string literals are not of type *string* from the C++ standard library.**
~~~
// examples of legal and illegal concatenation
string s4 = s1 + ", " + s2 + '\n'; // ok
string s5 = "hello" + ", " + s2; // error: no string operand for first + operator
string s6 = s1 + ", " + "world"; // ok, right equivalent to (s1 + ", ") + "world"
~~~

- analyzing the characters in a string
	- *cctype* library has functions for interpreting characters and changing characteristics like upper/lowercase
	- **range-based *for* loop** is good for processing every character in a string. (C++11)
		- the *auto* type specifier is useful here.
~~~
// example of using range for and the cctype library function ispunct
string s("hello world!!!");
decltype(s.size()) punct_cnt = 0;
for (auto c : s) {
	if (ispunct(c))
		++punct_cnt;
}
cout << punct_cnt << '\n';
~~~

- changing the characters in a non*const* string
	- **to change the value of the characters in string, we must define the loop variable as a reference type.**
~~~
// example of changing the characters in a string by reference
string s("hello world!!!");
for (auto &c : s)
	c = toupper(c); // cctype function returns uppercase version of argument
cout << punct_cnt << '\n';
~~~

- the **subscript operator [ ]** takes a *string::size_type* (unsigned) value that denotes the zero-indexed position of the character we want to access and returns a reference to that character.
	- **the result of using an index out of range is undefined.**
		- **valid range is >=0 && < size()**
		- **subscripting an empty string is undefined.**
	- **any time we use a subscript, we must ensure that there is a value at the given location.**
		- in this use case, we would check that the string isn't empty before using the [ ] operator.



### misc conventions and tips
- direct initialize is preferred when initializing objects with multiple values (parameters?)
- **don't use signed *int*s in subscript operators *[ ]* or expressions that use *size()*.**
	- size() returns a *string::size_type* value.
	- use auto to get the type if necessary, but remember it's unsigned!
- the C++ library incorporates the C library. the C++ version of C library headers are c*name* (remove the .h suffix and precede the name with the letter 'c').
	- when we include *cctype*, we are actually including the C++ version of the C library header *ctype.h*. 
	- using the c*name* form in C++ lets us access the C library header's namespace through *std*.



## things to follow up on
- my program compiles and runs without the #include directive for cctype. is it necessary/good practice to include it anyways?
