# chapter 3: strings, vectors, and arrays

## namespace *using* declarations (3.1)

### new core ideas
- the scope operator :: says that the compiler should look in the scope (namespace) of the left-hand operand for the name of the right-hand operatand
- a ***using*** declaration lets us use a name from a namespace without qualifying the name with *(namespace)::* prefix
	- a separate *using* declaration is required for each name

~~~
#include <iostream>
using std::cin; using std::cout;
int main() {
	int i;
	cin >> i; // cin is a synonym for std::cin
	cout << i << '\n'; // cout is a synonym for std::cout
	return 0;
}
~~~

### misc conventions and tips
- **code in headers should not use *using* declarations**
	- recall contents of a header are copied into the including programs text. if a header has a *using* declaration, then every program that includes that header gets that same *using* declaration.
