# Learning C++

## material

after much poking around on reddit, the ISO C++ website, and various other blogs from C++ developers, i decided to use ***C++ Primer*** (Lippman) as my primary beginner's resource for learning the language of C++! i've also heard/seen good things about Scott Meyers' ***Effective*** series, so i look forward to reading that after *Primer*.

## dev setup

i admittedly got caught up in the hype of finding "the most effective" development setup. i know i still have a long ways to go before these setups would impact improve my workflow (i gotta learn the language first!), but here's a rundown of common utilities i've been seeing:

**Compilers**:

- gcc
	- preinstalled in Linux
	- filesystem, concepts, transactional memory, special math
- [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)
	- "faithful implementation of the C++ language standard"
	- "useful as an excellent extra compiler to run to catch errors alongside your chosen production compiler"
		- quotes from [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-compiler-for-C-C++-programming#!n=24) lol
	
**Debuggers / Analyzers**:

- gdb
- [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org)
- Clang tools
	- [ASan, MSan, TSan](https://github.com/google/sanitizers)
	- [Static analyzer](http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/)

**Misc Workflow**:

- vim + [YCM](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe) + [rtags](https://github.com/Andersbakken/rtags) (with vim bindings)
- [conan](https://github.com/conan-io/conan) package manager
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/) (as a local environment manager? don't really understand this one)

and here's the **barebones** setup i'm planning on going through *Primer* with:

- gcc
- Sublime Text
	- [GitGutter](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/GitGutter)
	- [Clang Format](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Clang%20Format)
	- [C++11](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/C%2B%2B11) (syntax highlighter)
	- [EasyClangComplete](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/EasyClangComplete) (after getting basic C++ syntax down)
